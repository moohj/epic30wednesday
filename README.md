I wanted to define nightlife. so often people go out and its a waste of time and money. Sometimes people dont go out when they 
could have had a lot of fun. THis creates fomo. Millenials in particular are under a lot of pressure to seize the moment, fomo
(fear of missing out) is a big thing among the 19-35 year old age group. In some small way i hoped that this would help.
This was a first attempt at creating data that could be used to identify the metrics of an area for that purpose.
eventually i decided this data was too broad and scrapped the project.
